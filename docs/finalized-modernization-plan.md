# Finalized Modernization Plan for Lithium Recycling Dashboard

This document summarizes the agreed-upon plan for modernizing the Lithium Recycling Dashboard application using Vite and Vue 3.

## Goal

Complete the transition to a modern frontend architecture using Vite and Vue 3, ensuring current functionality is maintained and improved upon where necessary.

## Guiding Document

The primary guide for the implementation phases, steps, and rationale will be the existing detailed plan: `docs/modernization-plan.md`.

## Target Directory Structure

The project will be refactored to align with the following standard Vite/Vue structure:

```
/
├── public/             # Static assets (copied as-is)
│   └── ...
├── src/                # Source code (processed by Vite)
│   ├── assets/         # Processed assets (fonts, images, non-global CSS)
│   ├── components/     # Reusable Vue components (.vue)
│   ├── views/          # Page-level components/routes (.vue)
│   ├── router/         # Vue Router configuration (index.js)
│   ├── services/       # Business logic, API interaction, Firebase setup (.js)
│   ├── store/          # (Optional) Global state management (e.g., Pinia)
│   ├── styles/         # Global styles, variables (.css/.scss)
│   └── main.js         # Main application entry point
├── functions/          # Firebase Functions (Backend API) - Structure remains as is
│   ├── index.js
│   └── package.json
├── data/               # Static data files (e.g., facilities.json)
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── tests/              # Unit/Integration tests (Vitest)
│   └── unit/
├── .env                # Environment variables
├── .gitignore
├── firebase.json       # Firebase configuration
├── index.html          # Main HTML entry point for Vite
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js      # Vite configuration
└── README.md
```

## Current State Acknowledgement

We acknowledge that the modernization process is partially underway within the `src` directory, but the implementation is currently incomplete and inconsistent (e.g., mix of `.js` and `.vue` components/pages, unconventional structures). The existing code in `src` will be refactored to align with the target structure and standard Vue practices as part of executing the plan.

## First Implementation Step

Before any code changes are made, a new Git branch will be created specifically for this modernization effort to isolate the work.
